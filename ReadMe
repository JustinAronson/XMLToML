These python scripts are designed to convert complex xml files into flattened csv files.  They make the assumption that the XML file has a meta tag that incorporates the entire
file and that the next level in the hierarchy is a tag that encloses each record.  Within these records, the hierarchy can be deep and heterogeneus and the script will process them.
To execute the program, run xmlParser first.  Then run csvNormaliser.  Within csvNormaliser, there is a variable called minColumnEntries.  Setting this value to an integer greater than 0 will result
in the elimination of any columns with less than this number of entries from the table.
